# Prediction_using_Supervised_ML
Supervised learning as the name indicates the presence of a supervisor as a teacher. Basically in supervised learning we teach or train the machine using data which is already tagged with the correct answer. After that, the machine is provided with a new set of examples(data) so that supervised learning algorithm analyses the training data(set of training examples) and produces a correct outcome from labeled data. 
Types of Supervised ML:
  Linear Regression
  Nearest Neighbor
  Guassian Naive Bayes
  Decision Trees
  Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  Random Forest

In this notebook we are going to use Linear Regression with Python Scikit Learn and see how machine learning can be used to implement regression functions.

We will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied.

We will test what will be the predicted score of a student who study for 9.25 hrs in a day?
